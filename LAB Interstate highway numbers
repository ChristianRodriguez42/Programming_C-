/*Primary U.S. interstate highways are numbered 1-99. Odd numbers (like the 5 or 95) go north/south, 
and evens (like the 10 or 90) go east/west. Auxiliary highways are numbered 100-999, and service the 
primary highway indicated by the rightmost two digits. Thus, I-405 services I-5, and I-290 services I-90.

Given a highway number, indicate whether it is a primary or auxiliary highway. If auxiliary, indicate 
what primary highway it serves. Also indicate if the (primary) highway runs north/south or east/west. */
